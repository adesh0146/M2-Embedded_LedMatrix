# INTRODUCTION 

## Keyboard & Lcd Screen

This is a simple Embedded Project made in C language.

This is a 4x4 keypad that displays letters on the lcd screen based on which key has been pressed. 

## Atmega328 :
The high-performance Microchip 8-bit AVRÂ® RISC-based microcontroller combines 32 KB ISP Flash memory with read-while-write capabilities, 
1 KB EEPROM, 2 KB SRAM, 23 general purpose I/O lines, 32 general purpose working registers, three flexible timer/counters with compare modes,
internal and external interrupts, serial programmable USART, a byte-oriented Two-Wire serial interface, SPI serial port, 
6-channel 10-bit A/D converter (8-channels in TQFP and QFN/MLF packages), programmable watchdog timer with internal oscillator, 
and five software selectable power saving modes. The device operates between 1.8-5.5 volts.

## 4x4 Keypad: 
A 4X4 Keypad will have eight terminals. In them four are ROWS of MATRIX and four are COLUMNS of MATRIX. 
These 8 PINS are driven out from 16 buttons present in the MODULE.
Those 16 alphanumeric digits on the MODULE surface are the 16 buttons arranged in MATRIX formation.

## Lcd Screen :
A liquid-crystal display (LCD) is a flat-panel display or other electronically modulated optical device that
uses the light-modulating properties of liquid crystals combined with polarizers.

## SWOT Analysis

 Strength :
1. Low cost system
2. Experience the working on ATmega328 microcontroller and doing simulation on SimulIde.

Weakness :
1. Requires handson experience about Embedded programming.
 
Opportunities :
1. Can upgrade this system with new and upcomming technologies.

Threats :
1. Some time the system firmware gets defected as its very diffcuilt to unlock the system. 


## 4W's and 1'H
4W's

Who : Any one can use this device.


What : It is a Digital security system. 


When : To eliminate the traditional mechanical lock system. 


Where : Can be implemented where security is needed,or can be use for security purpose.

1'H

How : This project is implemented by using avr microcontroller ATMEGA328 ,16X2 Lcd Screen ,4x4 Matrix Keypad.
      And by using functionalities of c.
