# INTRODUCTION 

## Keyboard & Lcd Screen

This is a simple Embedded Project made in C language.

This is a 4x4 keypad that displays letters on the lcd screen based on which key has been pressed. 

## Atmega328 :
The high-performance Microchip 8-bit AVRÂ® RISC-based microcontroller combines 32 KB ISP Flash memory with read-while-write capabilities, 
1 KB EEPROM, 2 KB SRAM, 23 general purpose I/O lines, 32 general purpose working registers, three flexible timer/counters with compare modes,
internal and external interrupts, serial programmable USART, a byte-oriented Two-Wire serial interface, SPI serial port, 
6-channel 10-bit A/D converter (8-channels in TQFP and QFN/MLF packages), programmable watchdog timer with internal oscillator, 
and five software selectable power saving modes. The device operates between 1.8-5.5 volts.

## 4x4 Keypad: 
A 4X4 Keypad will have eight terminals. In them four are ROWS of MATRIX and four are COLUMNS of MATRIX. 
These 8 PINS are driven out from 16 buttons present in the MODULE.
Those 16 alphanumeric digits on the MODULE surface are the 16 buttons arranged in MATRIX formation.

## Lcd Screen :
A liquid-crystal display (LCD) is a flat-panel display or other electronically modulated optical device that
uses the light-modulating properties of liquid crystals combined with polarizers.

## SWOT Analysis
